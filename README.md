WeMap: Network Scanning and Security Tool
WeMap is an advanced network scanning tool designed to help IT professionals, developers, and security experts assess and monitor network services and security vulnerabilities. With its easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI), WeMap offers various features to scan ports, detect services, and check vulnerabilities.

Key Features
Port Scanning: Scan specific ports or ranges of ports to identify open services on a target system.

Service Detection: Automatically detect services associated with open ports and retrieve their banners (if available).

Operating System Detection: Identify the operating system of the target system based on open ports and service data.

SSL Support: Securely scan HTTPS-enabled services.

Vulnerability Checking: Check for known vulnerabilities related to open services (API not fully integrated).

Output Formatting: Customize the output to display in the console or save it to a file.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the WeMap repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wemap.git
cd wemap
2. Install Dependencies
WeMap uses Python, so youâ€™ll need to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux or macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Build Executable (Optional)
If you want to compile the tool into a standalone executable (optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --onefile wemap.py
This will create an executable inside the dist/ folder.

Usage
Running WeMap
Once installed, you can use WeMap from the command line. Below are a few examples:

1. Basic Port Scan
To scan a specific port range on a target host, use the following syntax:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py <target_host> <start_port> <end_port>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py 127.0.0.1 80 1024
This will scan ports 80 to 1024 on the host 127.0.0.1.

2. Verbose Output and SSL Support
Use the -v flag to enable verbose output and the --ssl flag to scan HTTPS-enabled services:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py <target_host> <start_port> <end_port> -v --ssl -o <output_file>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py 127.0.0.1 80 1024 -v --ssl -o result.txt
-v: Enables verbose output to display additional information about the scan.

--ssl: Indicates that the scan should check for SSL-enabled services.

-o <output_file>: Saves the scan results to a file (e.g., result.txt).

3. Scan a Range of Ports and Save the Output
To scan a range of ports and save the results to a file, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py 127.0.0.1 1 65535 -v -o scan_results.txt
This will scan all ports from 1 to 65535 and save the results to scan_results.txt.

4. Scan with OS Detection
WeMap can also attempt to detect the operating system based on open ports and services:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py <target_host> <start_port> <end_port> --os-detect
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py 127.0.0.1 80 1024 --os-detect
5. View Detailed Banner Information
To view the detailed banner information for a service, simply run the scan with verbose mode enabled:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py 127.0.0.1 80 1024 -v
WeMap will display any banner information available from the services running on the open ports.

Saving Scan Results
By default, WeMap will output the results to the terminal. However, you can save the results to a file by using the -o option followed by the file name:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 wemap.py 127.0.0.1 80 1024 -o report.txt
This will save the scan results to a file named report.txt.
